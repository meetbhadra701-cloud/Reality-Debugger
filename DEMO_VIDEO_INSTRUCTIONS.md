# Demo Video Instructions

## Overview

To test Reality Debugger, you need a 10-30 second video showing a cooking failure. The recommended scenario is a **collapsed soufflé or cake that didn't rise**.

## What to Capture

The video should show:

1. **Initial State**: The batter/dough being prepared or placed in the oven
2. **Key Events**:
   - Oven door opening (if applicable)
   - Visible collapse or failure to rise
   - Any audible cues (oven door closing, steam escaping, etc.)
3. **Failure State**: The final collapsed or failed result

## Recording Tips

- **Duration**: Keep it between 10-30 seconds for optimal analysis speed
- **Resolution**: Any standard resolution (720p or higher recommended)
- **Audio**: Include audio if possible (oven door sounds, etc.) but video-only works too
- **Format**: MP4 format required

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Collapsed Soufflé
- Show soufflé rising in oven
- Oven door opens (causing collapse)
- Soufflé collapses visibly
- Final collapsed state

### Scenario 2: Cake That Didn't Rise
- Show batter being mixed
- Batter placed in pan
- Time-lapse or real-time showing no rise
- Final flat result

## Where to Place the Video

1. Place your demo video in the `public/` directory as `demo.mp4`
2. Or upload it through the UI when testing

## Alternative: Using Existing Videos

If you don't want to record your own:
- Search YouTube for "collapsed soufflé" or "cake didn't rise" videos
- Download a short clip (10-30 seconds)
- Convert to MP4 if needed
- Use as your test video
